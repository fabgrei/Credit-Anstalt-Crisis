# The Credit-Anstalt Crisis of 1931

This is a short presentation I made for the economics PhD course "Financial Crises" by Gary Gorton and Andrew Metrick.

## A big bank in a small country

## Macroeconomic and political background: War, Hyperinflation, Depression, War

## The failure of the Austrian banking sector

Within the fifteen years after World War 1 the number of joint stock banks in Austria decreased from 76 to 31. That consolidation included many forced mergers and the collapse of the two biggest banks at the time. The reason for this failure of the Austrian banking sector a three fold:

- bad management
  
  Politicians and economist of the time criticised that the Viennese banks still had not realised the collapse of the Habsburg empire. Even though the banking sector shrank substantially (assets shrank by 70 %) much of the business was still done in the successor states (the former parts of the empire). Also, while the banks shrank substantially, their management did not. While the total payroll was 0.7 % of assets before the war, it was an incredible 7 % in 1924.
  
  Furthermore, the bankers prioritised reputation of sensibility. There was a race between banks about the highest dividends. They reported fake profits just to pay out dividends. Sometimes for more than ten years. That substantially reduced bank equity. Same went for the industrial companies that the banks controlled.

- bad policies

  After the hyper-inflation of the early 1920s there was a wave of collapsing banks and mergers. The mergers mostly were not sensible from a the business point of view. They were still undertaken for political pressure and the bankers' desire to grow ever faster. Having aquired a number of failed banks, Austria's second largest bank BCA collapsed in October 1929. Within two days it was merged into Credit-Anstalt, already Austria biggest bank. At that point in time, Credit-Anstalt was not in a good enough shape for the take-over. But that was unknown by the management (or kept secret).

- bad economics

  After the New York stock market crash on Black Friday in 1929 the global economy started to tank. Austria, with its small, open economy Austria, lost 65 % of its exports. The figure on slide 8 reveals that private and government consumption where quite stable. Exports started to fall in 1929, investment followed the year after.
  
  The economic slump translated directly to banks balance sheets through two channels. First, the banks were heavily invested in Austrian industry (as is and was customary in Austria). And second, bad credits led to huge write-offs.

## The collapse of Credit-Anstalt

In May 1931 the Credit-Anstalt announced losses worth 85 % of its equity. Given the reputation of the bank that came as a shock to the debtors, creditors, politiciains and the public. The losses became public only after the bank's new management insisted on a revisal of the balance sheet. Right after the announcement rumours started to circulate, which said that the actual losses are much higher than claimed. So despite the state's commitment to bail out the bank, there was a run on CA's deposits. In the next four days the bank extended their business hours. Within a month they lost about 25 % of their deposits. Right afterwards, bank runs took place in Germany, Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia. 

As it turned out later, the rumors were right. The losses of the bank were seven times bigger than announced, amounting to almost half the banks assets. The government and the national bank negotiated with foreign creditors to roll over their credits for two years. In return the government took responsibility for the remaining liabilities of 1.2 billion Schillings (when the annual federal budget was just 1.8 billion.)

It took a year until the bank's collapse was resolved. On the way, the Austrian government and its currency lost most of their reputation.
